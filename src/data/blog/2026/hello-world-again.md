Finally, I have revamped my blog.

Hello World Again

Previously I was using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and a nice enough theme [**barryclark/jekyll-now**](https://github.com/barryclark/). The problem was of course that things fell out of support, and frankly I'm not a Ruby dev.

I wanted something easier so I've turned to [Astro](https://astro.build/), which is mostly JS out of the box. Easy enough for me to understand, and modify. I'm also using the [Astro-Paper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper) theme. For a blog I don't really want to tinker. I just want to write and publish so I can focus on the things I really want to work on.

I'm still using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host this blog. It's still very easy and mostly automated.
