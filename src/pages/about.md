My first computer was a Pentium III, put together on the dining room table. A little beige box that contained the whole world. One small moment that spawned a lifetime of wonder and curiosity about all things technology and computers.

Currently a Senior Software Engineer II at [D&D Beyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com). Previously a Software Engineering Manager at the [University of North Florida](https://www.unf.edu).

My opinions are my own.
